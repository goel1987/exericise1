## Self-Reflection:
I feel that I have to review javascript and github again. I had not used github a lot in previous classes but need to review it again. It is an essential part of programming and need to do better on it. I had not taken javascript , html/css in awhile and will plan to review the subjects.

### How long it took me to finish this?
It took to long. I should have been able to complete it faster. I need to review the material again.
